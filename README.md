# G3-git task
## Highlights - Week 1
- Introduction to DevOps/Basic Linux Commands
- Version Control (Git & GitHub)

### My Learnings - Bisola
I learnt certain git commands such as:
- `git clone` which is used to clone a repository to your local device.
- `git status` to know the status of the repository.
- `git commit` to commit changes made locally.
- `git push` to push changes to your repository.
I also learned that you must fork a repository before cloning. People can collaborate using GitHub by forking, cloning, branching, pulling, and merging. To make these changes, you can use VS Code or Git Bash. I practiced certain Linux commands as well.

### My Learnings - Opeyemi
- DevOps helps to automate the development life cycle, build and release software faster, and reduce the time taken to get to production.
- It's important to properly set up infrastructure to easily roll back to previous working versions of an app if issues arise.
- I now better understand the need for Git/GitHub during development to help keep track of changes.
